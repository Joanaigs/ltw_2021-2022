Larica is a food delivery website we developed for LTW's 21/22 project. <br> <br>
Larica has several restaurants to choose from. When you open the website, you can search for a particular restaurant or cuisine.
When you've decided what you want to order, just tap the '+' and the order will be added to your shopping cart.
When you are ready to check out, you will see your address (with the possibility to modify it for that specific order) and the price of the order.
If everything is fine, tap Checkout and you're done.
